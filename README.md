# Test frontend

First install backend

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run dev`
3. go to `Don't have an account? Sign Up`

Basic authentication has been implemented, although certain aspects such as JEST tests, TypeScript types, error handling, and additional features remain pending due to time constraints and ongoing commitments with my current job.
